![ezgif com-gif-maker (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30610197/128618252-d00100dd-6ca4-4089-b7a1-d7790b99a1cc.gif)

## Features
cmdpxl has many exciting functionalities, including
- Editing pixels *one at a time*!
- Saving images!
- An undo function!
- A fill tool!
- Cool image filters!

## Installation
Requires `opencv-python`. It *should* be multiplatform, but it has only been tested on Windows 10.

Run with `py cmdpxl/main.py`.

## Command line interface
It also runs with `cli`, e.g., to create a 10x10 `png`:

`py cmdpxl/main.py -f new_image.png -res 10,10`

## Why?
Good question.
